\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    
    The rapid evolution of technology has propelled the development of large-scale applications, demanding innovative solutions to meet the challenges of modern software engineering. This research delves into the integration between OutSystems, Azure, and MongoDB, presenting a comprehensive review of their collaborative capabilities for handling extensive application deployments \cite{iscac}.
    
    The integration of OutSystems, a leading low-code platform, with Microsoft's Azure cloud services and the versatile MongoDB database offers a promising framework for addressing the complexities of contemporary software development. This research aims to explore the architecture, scalability, and practical implications of deploying large-scale applications within this integrated ecosystem.
    
    In this introductory chapter, we provide an overview of the motivation behind this study, the objectives set forth, and the structure of the research. Additionally, acknowledgments are extended to those whose guidance and support have been pivotal in the undertaking of this project.
    
    The subsequent chapters will delve into the technical intricacies of the integration, shedding light on implementation details, challenges faced, and best practices observed. Through this exploration, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the field of software engineering, aiding developers and enterprises in their pursuit of optimal solutions for large-scale application development and management.
