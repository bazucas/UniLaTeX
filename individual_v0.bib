    abstract = {This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgments under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces a theoretical framework that describes the importance of affect in guiding judgments and decisions. As used here, “affect” means the specific quality of “goodness” or “badness” (i) experienced as a feeling state (with or without consciousness) and (ii) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus. Affective responses occur rapidly and automatically—note how quickly you sense the feelings associated with the stimulus word “treasure” or the word “hate”. We argue that reliance on such feelings can be characterized as “the affect heuristic”. In this paper we trace the development of the affect heuristic across a variety of research paths followed by ourselves and many others. We also discuss some of the important practical implications resulting from ways that this heuristic impacts our daily lives.}

abstract = {This article reviews evidence indicating that, in most circumstances, positive affect enhances problem solving and decision making, leading to cognitive processing that is not only flexible, innovative, and creative, but also thorough and efficient. These results have implications regarding consumers’ potential reactions to affect generated by ads, products, consumption situations, and service encounters. These cognitive effects of positive affect are considered in the context of effects on social interaction that show that positive affect leads to helping, generosity, and interpersonal understanding. Together, these findings suggest implications especially for customer satisfaction, and particularly for a role for employee positive affect, or employee satisfaction, in generating customer satisfaction. Moreover, studies specifically in the domain of medical decision making and problem solving indicate that these implications would apply to the specific areas of doctor–patient interaction, medical decision making, and medical consumer satisfaction. Finally, it is suggested that the benefits of positive affect be considered when formulating healthcare policy and be included in economic models and policy decisions more generally as well.},

abstract = {Abstract Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes that ignore information. In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy. We review the major progress made so far: (a) the discovery of less-is-more effects; (b) the study of the ecological rationality of heuristics, which examines in which environments a given strategy succeeds or fails, and why; (c) an advancement from vague labels to computational models of heuristics; (d) the development of a systematic theory of heuristics that identifies their building blocks and the evolved capacities they exploit, and views the cognitive system as relying on an “adaptive toolbox;” and (e) the development of an empirical methodology that accounts for individual differences, conducts competitive tests, and has provided evidence for people’s adaptive use of heuristics. Homo heuristicus has a biased mind and ignores part of the available information, yet a biased mind can handle uncertainty more efficiently and robustly than an unbiased mind relying on more resource-intensive and general-purpose processing strategies.},

abstract = {Four studies examined the hypothesis that positive mood induces a global processing style and gives rise to the use of more abstract linguistic expressions in the description of social events. In contrast, negative mood induces a detail-oriented analytic processing style, resulting in more concrete descriptions. This hypothesis received support in the case of describing autobiographical events (Studies 1 and 2) and a film scene (Studies 3 and 4), whereby mood was induced either by film clips, or a self-induced mood technique (Study 3). Moreover, Study 4 showed that these systematic differences in linguistic expression disappear when the source of mood is made salient to participants, in line with the affect-as-information (Schwarz & Clore, 1983) and mood-and-general-knowledge approach (Bless, 2000). Implications for interpersonal communication are discussed.}

	volume={14},
	number={5},
	pages={350-363},
	abstract={In contrast to the traditional idea that the processing of visual information consists of a sequence of feedforward operations, with neuronal functional properties taking on increasing complexity as the information progresses through a hierarchy of cortical areas, increasing evidence points towards a reverse process, with higher-order cognitive influences interacting with information coming from the retina.Thus, rather than having a fixed functional role, neurons should be thought of as adaptive processors, changing their function according to the behavioural context.Vision is an active process in which higher-order cognitive influences affect the operations performed by cortical neurons.Visual pathways operate bidirectionally, with each feedforward connection being matched by feedback or re-entrant connections going from higher- to lower-order cortical areas.Top-down influences include various forms of attention, such as spatial, object oriented and feature oriented attention.Top-down influences are not limited to attention but mediate a much broader range of functional roles, including perceptual task, object expectation, scene segmentation, efference copy, working memory and the encoding and recall of learned information.The effect of top-down influences is to change the information conveyed by neurons, both by altering the tuning of their responses to stimulus attributes and by changing the structure of correlations over neuronal ensembles.All areas of the visual pathway, except for the retina, are subject to top-down influences, including early cortical stages of visual processing such as the primary visual cortex and the lateral geniculate nucleus, and all areas along the dorsal and ventral visual cortical pathways. Each area contains an association field of potential interactions, and expresses a subset of these interactions to execute different functions.The sources of top-down influences are widespread, with each area providing information reflecting the functional properties of that area. As a consequence, even a single neuron can be viewed as a microcosm of activity occurring throughout the visual pathway.We propose that the circuit mechanism of top-down control and adaptive processing involves a gating of intrinsic cortical circuits within an area mediated by long-range feedback connections to that area. By selecting a subset of inputs, a neuron can express different components of its association field, and as a result take on different functional roles.},
